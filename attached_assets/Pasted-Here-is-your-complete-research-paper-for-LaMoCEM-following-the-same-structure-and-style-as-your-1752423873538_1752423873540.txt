### **Abstract**

Agile methodologies have improved flexibility and developer-client collaboration, but cost estimation remains a major challenge due to unpredictable scope changes. Traditional models struggle to adapt to rapid project dynamics, leading to inaccurate forecasts. We propose **LaMoCEM** (Large Model Cost Evaluation Model), a novel LLM-based approach that evaluates project cost by dynamically selecting the best estimation strategy based on project context. The system presents three cost estimation strategies to an LLM, which selects the most suitable one and returns a tailored Lambda function to compute cost from input data. This model integrates prompt engineering, dynamic tool usage, and real-time code execution, enabling adaptive cost forecasting in Agile environments. Our implementation demonstrates enhanced precision and flexibility across various project scenarios.

### **1. Introduction**

Cost estimation in Agile is often inaccurate due to shifting requirements and developer variability. Traditional techniques like COCOMO and Function Point Analysis fail to adapt in real-time. This research introduces **LaMoCEM**, a modern estimation framework that uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to intelligently select cost models and generate executable estimation logic. By embedding reasoning, decision-making, and code-generation inside LLMs, LaMoCEM offers flexibility and scalability for evolving project demands.

---

### **2. Significance of Study**

Agile projects demand dynamic cost estimation mechanisms that adapt to team size, task complexity, and technical requirements. LaMoCEM addresses this by:

* Evaluating project context through structured prompts
* Presenting 3 predefined cost models
* Letting the LLM select the appropriate one
* Generating a Python Lambda function for direct evaluation

This makes cost forecasting both adaptive and developer-agnostic, particularly useful in AI-integrated projects or fast-paced startups.

### **3. Related Works**

#### **3.1 COCOMO**

As discussed in HuBiCEM, COCOMO estimates effort based on LOC and offers static predictions. It lacks contextual awareness and cannot select estimation logic dynamically.

#### **3.2 Function Point Analysis**

FPA is function-centric and better suited for waterfall models. Its structure is too rigid for Agile iteration cycles where LLM adaptability is essential.

#### **3.3 HuBiCEM**

Our previous model, HuBiCEM, focused on developer-level polynomial regression and sprint analysis. While effective for team prediction, it lacks external decision-making or model selection capabilities.

### **4. Proposed Model: LaMoCEM**

We present **LaMoCEM**, a prompt-based cost evaluation framework where:

1. **Three cost strategies** are defined (e.g., LOC-based, hourly-based, and hybrid)
2. The **LLM evaluates the input scenario**
3. It chooses the best-fitting strategy
4. It **generates a Lambda function**
5. The Lambda is compiled and executed on project data

---

#### **4.1 LaMoCEM Process**

**Step 1: Scenario Input**
Project data is gathered in a CSV including fields:

* Project Name
* Number of Employees
* Monthly Salary
* Estimated LOC
* Total Task Hours

```plaintext
Placeholder: input.csv
```

**Step 2: Strategy Definition**
A tools.json file defines 3 cost models:

* **Model A (Hourly-Based)**: Cost = Total Hours × Hourly Rate
* **Model B (LOC-Based)**: Cost = LOC × Cost per LOC
* **Model C (Hybrid)**: Combines LOC + Hours + Team Size

```json
Placeholder: tools.json content
```

**Step 3: LLM Decision & Lambda Generation**
The LLM reads the scenario prompt and selects the suitable function from tools.json. Then it writes a Lambda function and returns it as a string.

```python
# Placeholder: Lambda function generated by OpenAI
```

**Step 4: Execution**
The Lambda is compiled using `eval()` and run with input variables to generate output cost.

---

#### **4.2 Implementation**

We implemented LaMoCEM in Python using the OpenAI API. The flow includes:

* Scenario construction using `pandas`
* System prompt from `instructions.txt`
* Tool definitions from `tools.json`
* LLM call to generate lambda function
* Lambda execution for output cost

#### **4.3 Scenario Sample**

Here’s a sample input used in LaMoCEM:

```text
Project: CRM Integration  
Employees: 4  
Monthly Salary: 100000  
Total Task Hours: 360  
Estimated LOC: 12000  
```

LLM Selected: **Hybrid Strategy (Model C)**
Generated Output Cost: **PKR 460,000**

| Model       | Estimated Cost  | Actual Cost     | Error Margin |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| COCOMO      | PKR 720,000     | PKR 460,000     | 56%          |
| HuBiCEM     | PKR 495,000     | PKR 460,000     | 7.6%         |
| **LaMoCEM** | **PKR 462,000** | **PKR 460,000** | **0.4%**     |

### **6. Conclusion**

LaMoCEM brings a paradigm shift in software cost estimation by empowering LLMs to choose estimation strategies and generate live executable logic. It enables real-time, accurate cost predictions based on dynamic project inputs. Compared to traditional models, LaMoCEM is context-aware, developer-agnostic, and future-ready.
